## Some ideas

*  Support configuration profile according to the price of the storage, data delivery, usage, typical reseacrh flow/tasks. The sysyem can adapt the compression algrothms to the profile and reduce the costs and/or improve performance of specific tasks
*  Database dedicated for storing and accessing the genome. For example, "projections" (a term from Vertica) can be generated for fast lookup of specific seqences in the genome.
